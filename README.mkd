markdown2html 
=============


An utility to convert markdown to html for static usage.

The script itself is quite small, it is based on
[node.js](http://nodejs.org/), and uses
[showdown](http://attacklab.net/showdown/).


Usage
-------

For example: `markdown2html -i Readme.mkd -o Readme.html` should
result with a file `Readme.html`.

### Options

* `--wrap` will add a HTML5 compliant header and wrap the contents
  in `html` and `body` 

* `--style <css>` will include the supplied string as CSS, 
  this option can be specified multiple times

* `--style someStyleFile.css` will include the contents (not a
  hyper-link to the file!) of the file `someStyleFile.css` as CSS;
  the option value will be treated as a CSS-string if the file is
  not found

* if '-i' is not specified, _stdin_ is used

* same as above with '-o' and _stdout_

* '-i' can be used multiple times to concatenate several input files 
 

xhtml2latex
===========

Converting _html_ to _latex_ is questionable to begin with.  This
works for a few limited usecases I do have. Your mileage may vary.

### Options

* `--wrap` will add latex headers

* `-i` and `-o` options work like in _markdown2html_ 



Piping
======

The two commands can be conveniently chained by unix-piping, like: 

     markdown2html -i test/fixture/document.mkd -w | xhtml2latex

Note that _xhtml2latex_ requires a complete xml structure, so the `--wrap` option
for _markdown2html_ is required.


Install 
=======

For the time being:

1. install the node package manager [npm](http://npmjs.org/)
0. install the _simpleapp_ library
0. change into the main directory and issue `npm link` 


Development
===========

The source is tiny, straight forward, written in
[CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) and
located in the `src` directory.

Stylesheets are written in [_sass_](http://sass-lang.com/). Recompiling
them requires the ruby gem [_haml_](http://haml-lang.com/).

Running tests and builds is most conveniently done by `cake test`
or respectively `cake build`.
