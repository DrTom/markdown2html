The _markdown2html_ and _xhtml2latex_ Test Sheet
================================================

This page provides a few test cases for 
_markdown2html_ and _xhtml2latex_.

Italics and Bold Text
=====================

There is _italics_ and **bold** in this paragraph.


Links and Hyperefs 
===================

We have links, e.g. to [markdown2html](https://github.com/DrTom/markdown2html), and
spelled out links  <https://github.com/DrTom/simplecli>, too.


Lists
======

Unordered List
--------------
* item 
* yet an other item

Ordered List
--------------
0. first item 
0. second item
0. you can number correctly but setting all to `0.` works just fine


Code
=====

Indented Code
-------------

Code can be marked by 4 spaces or one tab indention:

    println "some code"
    # a comment 
    x <- a * b

This will be shown as a code block.

Inline Code
------------

In-line code can be made with backticks like in here:  `y <- sin x`. 

Code in pre-tags
---------------

Lastly we can use `<pre>` in very much the same sense as indention:

<pre>in pre tag
one more line
last line  
</pre>

Headers 
============

This is a H1 Header
===================

This is a H2 Header 
-------------------

### This is a H3 Header 

#### This is a H4 Header

##### This is a H5 Header

###### This is a H6 Header

Note, in latex everything from H4 down is mapped to a latex paragraph headers.
